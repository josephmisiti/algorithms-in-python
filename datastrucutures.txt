array:
	- sequential organization is implicit by position
	- size must be known before-hand (in compile languages)

linked lists:
	
	- each node contains link to next node
	

	advantages:
		- can grown and shrink of the size of a program's lifetime
		- provide flexability in allowing items to be rearranged efficiently
		
	disadvantages:
		- find kth item in the list ( results in O(N) search )
		- find previous item in the list (this is not a doubly linked list)
		- doubly linked list resolve this issue , at the cost of having to do
		to link manipulations per insert/delete etc.
		
pushdown stack
	- two operations: push and pop
	- insert/delete in beginning 
	- can be implemented with arrays or linked list
	- last in, first out (LIFO)
	
queues:
	FIFO - first in first out
	
trees:
	- collection  of vertices and edges that satisfies certain requirements
